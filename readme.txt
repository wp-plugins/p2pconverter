== Description ==
Converts either a static Page into a Post, or a Post into a static Page!
Just click on the Manage tab in the Admin interface, and click the Posts or Pages sub-tab.
Within that page you will see an extra column, with a Convert! option. If you want to convert
a page or a post to the either, click that link! Or you can click Convert while editing a post or page in the bottom right side bar.  A p2pConverter role capability prevents unwanted users from converting pages (i.e. only Administrators and Editors have this ability), which can be adjusted by using a Role Manager plugin.

== Installation ==
Copy the `p2pConverter` directory to your plugins directory and activate the p2pConverter
plugin from WordPress, and volia! You will now be able to convert!
